# intro-quantum-computing

This repo stores some of the code I wrote while reading through a great quantum computing textbook by [Thomas Wong](https://www.thomaswong.net/). I ran some of it on quantum computers via the [IBM Quantum Platform](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/).

### Phase / Eigenvalue Estimation (circuit on cover of textbook)
- Quantum gates are unitary, so their eigenvalues are of the form `e^(ix)`, where `x` is real and is the phase of the eigenvalue
- Upper part input and output is n-bit eigenvector of matrix U --- eigenstate |v>
- Lower part output is m-bit binary decimal `j` that gives `x = 2pi * j`
  - So we estimate the phase --> eigenvalue with m bits of precision
